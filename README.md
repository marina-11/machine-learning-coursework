Final coursework of Year 3 Introductory Applied Machine Learning course

You can find the final deliverable as IAML_CW2.pdf. This includes all the tasks for the final coursework of the IAML course (counting for 30% of the final mark) together with my 
solutions.

The dataset for question 1 is a collection of medical records of 800 people, where each record consists of nine real-valued features, which are the measurements for attributes 
’A0’,. . .,’A8’, and a binary class label of 0 or 1, where 1 indicates that the person has a particular disease, and 0 indicates that they do not.

Question 2  uses a subset of the EMNIST dataset of images, restricting characters to the English alphabet of 26 letters in upper case. The class labels are given in alphabetical 
order, where class 0 corresponds to ’A’ and 25 to ’Z’. There are 300 training instances and 100 test instances per class. Each instance is a 28-by-28 grayscale image.
